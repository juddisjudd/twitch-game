# Twitch Chat Game

This is a Twitch chat powered game.


### Premise
In a crumbling, dystopian future, the remnants of society are governed not by a single ruler but by the collective will of an unknown mass—the Twitch chat. In “`insert-clever-game-name`>`,” every command, emoji, and vote from chat shapes the destiny of the world. As mysterious events occur, players (the chat) gradually uncover hidden truths behind society’s collapse. The game’s narrative slowly reveals clues to a deep mystery, and when the final puzzle is solved, a concluding “credits” screen honors every viewer who contributed.
